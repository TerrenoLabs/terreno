 * the queue is empty or parked; when it parks on a backoff, a single
 * `setTimeout` wakes the next drain automatically so callers never need to
 * poll.
 *

 * of the FIFO queue (≤ `batchSize`, at most one mutation per entity per
 * chunk) through `sendMutationBatch` when available, walking the results in
 * order with the same per-outcome handlers above, then applying the B4
 * stop-the-line policy to whatever the batch response implies. Chunks with no
